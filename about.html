    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Hi, I'm Natasha Fredericks</h2>
    <p>
      With over 10 years of experience in administration and digital coordination, Iâ€™ve built Project2Pixel to empower small businesses and NGOs through clean, professional design and powerful backend support.
    </p>
    <p>
      I combine my expertise in project management, tech, and storytelling to craft digital experiences that are not just beautiful â€” but purposeful. From responsive websites to administrative systems that save you time, everything I create is built with care and intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey from the film and production world to full-stack development gives me a unique edge in understanding both creative and technical demands. When you partner with Project2Pixel, you get reliability, structure, and creativity â€” in one package.

    <h3>ðŸŒ± Vision</h3>
    <p>
      To be the go-to digital support studio for under-resourced creatives, businesses and NGOs who need more than just a pretty website â€” they need digital confidence, operational ease, and smart systems that scale.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Project2Pixel, our mission is to bridge the digital gap for purpose-driven people by delivering affordable, clean, functional websites and support services that actually make life easier. We aim to merge beauty with backend efficiency â€” one project at a time.
