            <h1>Hi, I'm Natasha Fredericks</h1>
            <p>Web developer by code, admin by nature, and creative by heart. With over a decade of experience juggling calendars, chaos, and client requests, I now bring that same structured magic to websites. I believe websites should work *for* you — not just look pretty. That’s why I design with wit, purpose, and human understanding.</p>
